    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p> Hello, I'm Waleed Abul Khair, the eldest in my family, hailing from a modest background. I embarked on my academic journey by completing my O-Levels and FSC in Pre-Computer Science, setting the foundation for my passion for datascience. Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science, where I'm honing my skills in the field of data analysis and interpretation. Beyond academics, I find joy in two diverse passions - playing video games, which fuel my strategic thinking, and cricket, which keeps me physically active and connected to the thrill of team sports. I'm excited to explore and contribute to the world of data science.       </p>
